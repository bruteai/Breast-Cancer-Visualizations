# Breast Cancer Data Visualization

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of visualizations to explore the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) as well as the version available via scikit-learnâ€™s `load_breast_cancer()` function. The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 real-valued features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses, along with a binary target indicating whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualization techniques:

1. **Diagnosis Distribution:**  
   A count plot displaying the number of benign vs. malignant cases.

2. **Correlation Heatmap:**  
   A heatmap illustrating the correlation between different features.

3. **Pair Plot of Top 4 Features:**  
   A pair plot for the top 4 high-variance features to show pairwise relationships, colored by diagnosis.

4. **PCA Scatter Plot:**  
   A scatter plot of the dataset projected onto the first two principal components, highlighting class separation.

5. **t-SNE Visualization:**  
   A t-SNE plot for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, offering another perspective on class separability.

6. **Histograms for Each Feature:**  
   Histograms (with KDE overlays) for all 30 features, providing insight into their distributions.

7. **Boxplots by Diagnosis:**  
   Boxplots of each feature grouped by diagnosis, which help in identifying differences between benign and malignant cases.
